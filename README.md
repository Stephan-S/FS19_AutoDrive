If you want to support my development effort, the best way is to open issues on any bugs you encounter or for features you would like to be added to the mod.

### For a little thank you
If you like our work, feel free to buy us a coffee (of which we drink quite a lot :D )  
For now, there is no general link for the team, so each contributer can post his/her preferred donation link here :-)  
But remember, this is absolutely not required. We value any issues and feature requests the same!  
And to all who do donate: Thank you very much :-)
